# PolyBot

5-min BTC Up/Down trader for Polymarket. **The deployable strategy is the
late-window sniper** (§2) — the one edge that survived testing, gated by a
pre-registered kill bar (`tasks/todo.md` is the live status + go-live runbook).
The **base strategy** (§3) runs in paper only as the evidence engine; its
go-live gate failed final on 2026-07-01 and it is barred from real money —
`sniper_only: true` suppresses it on the live flip.

**This file is the single source of truth — update it in the same commit as any
behavioral change.**

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp polybot/config/.env.example polybot/config/.env
# Required: DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN (monitoring)
# Live mode also needs: POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY, POLYMARKET_FUNDER

python -m polybot.main --mode paper       # paper trading
python -m polybot.main --mode live        # real USDC (needs allowance)
python -m polybot.main --run-pipeline     # one nightly cycle, no trading
python -m pytest polybot/tests/           # full suite
.\scripts\run_polybot.ps1                 # daily cycle: trade -> nightly jobs -> commit -> restart
```

**Go-live flip** (only after the sniper kill bar passes — `tasks/todo.md`):
`settings.yaml` → `mode: live` + `late_window.sniper_only: true`. That is the
complete switch; paper and live share every decision path.

### Secrets

| Key | When |
|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Always (monitoring) |
| `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` | Live mode (EIP-712 signing) |
| `POLYMARKET_FUNDER` | Live mode (USDC funding address) |

# Part A — Trading Logic

## 1. The market + the two modes

Every 5 min, Polymarket runs a market: will BTC close higher or lower than at
the window's start? Up/Down ERC-1155 tokens trade $0-$1; the winning side pays
$1/share. Chainlink (via Polymarket RTDS, tracking Coinbase) is the resolution
source; Gamma mirrors it for discovery. Two modes, one engine: **paper**
(realism shim: real CLOB books, FOK semantics, convex slippage,
network-fail/latency jitter calibrated to the measured warm POST RTT
~0.118-0.138s, $1 min, tick snapping) and **live** (`py-clob-client-v2` FOK
against the real CLOB; USDC balance + allowance verified at boot).

## 2. The late-window sniper — the deployable edge

In the final `sniper_late_start_s` (45s) of a window, a sharp Coinbase move
(the resolution venue) can push price past the strike while the CLOB ask lags
~350ms behind. The sniper buys that side at the stale price before the book
reprices.

- **Fire condition** (`SignalEngine.evaluate_late_sniper`): Coinbase move over
  `sniper_move_window_s` (2s) ≥ `sniper_cb_move` ($8) pushed price past strike
  AND the chosen side's ask ≤ `sniper_ask_cap` (0.92). The main loop wakes on
  Coinbase ticks when enabled.
- **What it bypasses**: ONLY `max_edge` (→ `sniper_max_edge` 0.50, at both the
  edge-cap and pre-submit gates) and the late-window time penalty. Every other
  gate stays — adverse selection, edge-decay, depth, net-edge, min-size,
  pre-submit VWAP re-check, feed freshness, and an L1 edge floor
  (`sniper_min_edge` = `min_edge`).
- **Kill bar** (deployment authority, at the host's measured RTT):
  `analyze_late_window.py` momentum `t_day ≥ 2.0` AND block-bootstrap `p10 > 0`
  over ≥ 8 clean ET days, ≥ 6 positive, ≥ 40 fills, net of fee, control ~0 —
  PLUS the paper-shadow tracking the harness (`sniper_shadow_status.py`).
  Current status, decision table, and runbook: `tasks/todo.md`.
- **Sniper-only mode** (`late_window.sniper_only`) — the go-live switch:
  base-entry BUYs are suppressed and recorded as `sniper_only` ghosts (free
  evidence), capital deploys only on sniper fires. Live recipe: `mode: live` +
  `sniper_enabled: true` + `sniper_only: true`.
- **Post-live kill rule**: re-run the harness every 2-3 days; trailing-4-day
  lenient mean < +2¢/sh or trailing-8-day t < 2 → set `sniper_enabled: false`.

## 3. The base strategy (paper-only evidence engine)

Entry = inventory sourcing off a single fair-value model; **no proven edge**
(binding 10-day read failed 2026-07-01: t_day +1.07; paper P&L swings are
BTC-vol variance). It keeps running in paper because it exercises the exit
engine and generates the outcome/ghost/counterfactual evidence stream.

**The L1 model** (the only model — never rebuild entry-side prediction):

```
ac         = clamp(lag1_autocorr(closes, regime_lookback), ±0.5)
vol_scaled = (max(atr, atr_floor) / atr_sigma_ratio) * sqrt(minutes_remaining) * sqrt((1+ac)/(1-ac))
z          = (btc_price - strike) / vol_scaled
prob_up    = StudentT_CDF(df, z * sqrt(df/(df-2)))        # df clamped ≥3
```

- `student_t_cdf` + df clamp + `autocorr_vol_scale` in `core/aux_layers.py`.
- ATR floor is dynamic: `max(min_atr, 0.30*rolling_20)`, widened when
  `rolling_20/long_term_200 < atr_regime_shift_threshold`. ATR buffers keep one
  slot per 1-min candle (entry + exit ticks share the dedup).
- `btc_price` from Coinbase WS only (<2s stale → decision skipped, never
  zeroed) — the venue Chainlink resolves against.
- L1 is uncalibrated (`model_probability` == `model_probability_raw`).

**Entry gates** — edge = `model_prob - market_price`; all must pass:

| Gate | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Chosen-side prob | ≥ `min_model_probability` (0.56) |
| Edge | ≥ `min_edge` (0.04; flip premium scales it — §6) |
| Kelly (fee-aware) | ≥ `min_kelly` (0.01); `b_eff = b*(1-fee_rate)` |
| Spread | `spread/2 + EFFECTIVE_FEE_PEAK ≤ max_spread` (0.10) |
| Book depth | ≥ `min_book_depth_usd` ($50) on the chosen side |
| Price sum | `price_up + price_down ∈ [0.98, 1.02]` |
| Book freshness | both sides' WS books ≤ 10s old |
| Edge cap | edge ≤ `max_edge` (0.20) — wider = stale phantom price |
| ATR | ≥ 5th percentile (lower bound only) |
| Adverse-selection hard skip | `adverse_rate_at_30s ≥ 0.80` |
| Edge-decay | mean 15s post-fill drift ≥ −0.05 (needs ≥15 resolved fills/30min) |
| Net edge after slippage | `edge − price*est_slip ≥ min_edge` |
| Pre-submit re-check | FOK VWAP keeps net edge in `[min_edge, max_edge]` |
| Min order | ≥ $1 (CLOB floor; paper mirrors live) |
| Feed staleness | Coinbase ≤30s, Chainlink ≤60s, Binance aggTrade ≤30s, kline ≤45s |

Adverse selection also scales size:
`kelly_mult = max(0.30, 1 − 1.5*max(0, adverse_rate − 0.45))`, Bayesian-shrunk.

**Ghosting**: every gate veto records a ghost (`GhostTracker`) that resolves at
window close — the evidence stream for gate evaluation.

## 4. Sizing (applies to both strategies)

```
size  = bankroll * kelly * circuit_breaker_mult * time_mult * adverse_kelly_mult
size *= concurrent_multiplier(side, market, opens)     # correlation-aware
size  = min(size, bankroll * max_bankroll_deployed)    # 0.80
size  = min(size, side_depth * max_book_fill_pct)      # 0.50
if size < 1.0: skip
```

- **Circuit breaker**: tier-locked floor at $100/150/200/... milestones
  (floor = tier × 0.85; sqrt Kelly interpolation down to 0.40×; tier never
  resets down; persists via `peak_bankroll`).
- **Time multiplier**: full Kelly for the first 60% of the window; after,
  penalty scales by (1 − conviction) up to 0.30. (Sniper bypasses this.)

## 5. Orders

FOK via `py-clob-client-v2`, up to 3 attempts with jittered backoff — only
exchange-confirmed rejections retry; ambiguous outcomes never resubmit
(double-fill guard). **Latency is at the floor** (~120ms warm POST RTT,
measured): presigned signatures off the hot path, WS-only book pre-check + fill
VWAP, tick-size/neg-risk/fee + contract-version caches prewarmed per window,
warm pooled HTTP/2 singleton (keepalive_expiry 60s > 5s ping, connect timeout
5s, TCP_NODELAY). The only remaining lever is geographic
(docs/DEPLOY_ORACLE_VPS.md, ~40ms EU VPS). Live boot: key+funder required,
balance/allowance preflight, allowance recheck every 10 fills. Per-trade DB
writes are atomic. `fill.fill_size` is always USDC notional.

## 6. The exit engine + flips (manages every position, sniper included)

Every tick while holding, re-run L1 and decide HOLD vs EXIT
(`SignalEngine.evaluate_hold`). `holding_edge = model_prob - bid`; the exit
threshold blends `exit_edge_threshold` (−0.10) with the binary-payoff
`ExitBoundary` curve (deep-ITM patience, OTM urgency, ATM fee-aware time
value); the blend is stamped so the phantom-bid SELL re-verify gates against
the same number.

Branches in order: **loss-cut** (market < entry×0.65, <90s left, BTC wrong
side of strike by >0.5×ATR), **deep-loss hold** (holding_edge < −0.10 and
market < entry → binary residual beats locking the loss), **scalp**
(holding_edge ≤ effective threshold, outside the whipsaw cushion), else
**hold**. No confidence overrides.

Re-entry after a scalp (one position per window; `max_concurrent_positions`
caps across windows) requires clearing a flip hurdle:
`min_edge + max(flip_premium, spread + 2*fee_rate*p*(1-p))`, premium
`0.015 + 0.005*max(0, flips-2)`.

**Resolution**: Chainlink decides; winner $1/loser $0 credited atomically.
Exit price is oracle-first (`event_metadata` final_price vs price_to_beat;
Gamma resolved prices as fallback; never Binance); Chainlink orphan fallback
after ~30 min of Gamma silence. Live redeems settle non-blockingly.

**Passive exits** (`passive_exit_enabled`): OFF — measured −2.1¢/sh ≈ −$62/day
(t_day −2.03) over 8 clean days. The code path (paper tape-sim, live GTD rest +
FOK fallback, maker-rebate accounting kept OUT of pnl) remains implemented and
tested but stays off; never a reason to rest new quotes.

## 7. Recorders + evidence stream

- **Window-path recorder** (`recording.py`, in-process; 1 Hz, 5 Hz in the final
  45s): both tokens' BBO + top-3 depth, Coinbase mid, strike, Binance
  price/CVD, live-L1 ATR + prob stamp (NULL on cold feeds, never 0.0) for
  EVERY window (~288/day, self-discovering). Tables `window_paths` (gitignored
  sidecar DB) / `window_labels`; 90-day retention nightly. **This is the sniper
  kill-bar feed and the post-live kill-rule input.**
- **Tape recorder**: every CLOB print → `memory/recordings/*.jsonl`
  (gitignored).
- **Wallet fingerprints** (`wallets.py`): nightly data-api ingestion →
  per-wallet markout → donor/noise/sharp (`wallet_stats`; write-only, no
  decision-time reader).
- **Per-decision records**: `trade_context` stamped into outcomes + ghosts
  (entry facts, model prob, flow/CVD telemetry, book aux, adverse audit
  fields). **None-vs-0.0 is load-bearing**: cold feeds record `None`, never
  0.0. `CounterfactualTracker` records both arms of every scalp/hold — the
  ground truth for exit-policy changes (score via `actual − cf`, never a naive
  signed sum of `delta_pnl`).
- **NightlyScheduler** (23:45 ET): record rollups + retention sweep + wallet
  tables.

## 8. Hard rules

- No early/mid-window entry-side prediction (ML or rules) — the CLOB price
  wins; the final-45s sniper is the one sanctioned exception, through its bar.
- The base strategy never deploys live. No deployment before a kill bar passes;
  never relax a bar to pass it.
- No symmetric market-making, no oracle-cadence trading, no expansion past BTC
  until the goal completes (`tasks/todo.md`).
- No Gaussian, no Binance resolution, no mid-price edge math (executable CLOB
  BBO only). Never skip the fee: `rate*shares*p*(1-p)`, rate 0.07
  (`DEFAULT_FEE_RATE`); flat-additive gates use `EFFECTIVE_FEE_PEAK` 0.0175 —
  never mix them.
- `gain_pct = pnl/size`, never log_return. Don't bypass the circuit breaker.
  Don't delete `polybot/db/polybot_*.db`.

## 11. Running + invariants

`run_polybot.ps1`: starts 12:01 AM ET, stops trading 11:30 PM ET, nightly jobs
11:45 PM ET, commits + pushes `origin main` on a clean exit, restarts at
midnight. **Single-instance guarded**: the wrapper refuses to start if another
is running, and `polybot.main` holds an OS single-instance lock
(localhost-port bind). Live preflight: `verify_keys.py` then
`smoke_order_test.py --confirm`.

- UTC for storage; ET (`America/New_York`) only for date-bucketing + trading
  windows. Daily rollups bundle per-trade JSON; readers glob both.
- Recordings (`memory/recordings/`) are gitignored — never in the nightly
  commit. `memory/` records + per-mode DB + settings.yaml are committed
  nightly.
- Kill bars are the deployment authority (`tasks/todo.md` = status + runbook).
